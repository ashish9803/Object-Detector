# Object-Detector
This project recognizes any green object when placed in front of the camera. In this project, two libraries are used, first one is opencv and the other one is numpy. The desired result is shown with the help of three frames namely, mask, maskOpen and maskClose. In mask frame, the green object is detected but the noise in the frame is very high which is reduced in maskOpen frame and more reduced in maskClose frame. Moreover, the green section of any object which comes in front of the camera is outlined by a blue line whicb makes it more convenient to recognize the green section present in the camera frame.
